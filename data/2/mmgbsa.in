Sample input file for GB calculation
This input file is meant to show only that gmx_MMPBSA works. Althought,
we tried to used the input files as recommended in the Amber manual,
some parameters have been changed to perform more expensive calculations
in a reasonable amount of time. Feel free to change the parameters 
according to what is better for your system.

# In gmx_MMPBSA v1.5.0 we have added a new PB radii set named charmm_radii. 
# This radii set should be used only with systems prepared with CHARMM force fields.
